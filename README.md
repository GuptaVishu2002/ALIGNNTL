# ALIGNNTL

This repository contains the code for ALIGNN-based transfer learning framework to predict materials properties using structure-based inputs. The code provides the following functions:

* Train a ALIGNN model on a given dataset.
* Use a pre-trained ALIGNN model to perform fine-tuning based transfer learning on a given target dataset.
* Use a pre-trained ALIGNN model to perform feature extraction on a given target dataset.
* Predict material properties of new compounds with a pre-trained ALIGNN model.

To perform fine-tuning based transfer learning please refer to [`FineTuning`](./FineTuning) and to perform feature extraction please refer to [`FeatureExtraction`](./FeatureExtraction)
