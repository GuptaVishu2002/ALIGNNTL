# ALIGNNTL: Feature Extraction

This directory contains information on how to perform feature extraction using ALIGNN.

### Instructions

The user requires following files in order to start training a model using fine-tuning method
* Sturcture files - contains structure information for a given material (format: `POSCAR`, `.cif`, `.xyz` or `.pdb`) 
* Pre-trained model - model trained using ALIGNN using any specific materials property (format: `.zip`)

We have provided the an example of Sturcture files (`POSCAR` files) in [`examples`](../examples). Download the pre-trained model trained on large datasets from <a href="https://figshare.com/projects/ALIGNN_models/126478">here</a>.
